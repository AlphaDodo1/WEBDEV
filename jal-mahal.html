        <h2>About Jal Mahal</h2>
        <p>Jal Mahal, or the "Water Palace," is a magnificent architectural showcase located in the middle of Man Sagar Lake. This palace appears to float majestically on the lake's calm waters, creating a mesmerizing sight that attracts visitors from around the world.</p>
        
        <div class="history-section">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Built in the 18th century by Maharaja Jai Singh II, the Jal Mahal was originally constructed as a hunting lodge for the royal family. The palace is a five-story building, of which four floors remain underwater when the lake is full.</p>
            
            <p>The architecture of Jal Mahal is a perfect blend of Rajput and Mughal styles. The palace was constructed using the special Rajput technique of lime mortar. The terrace gardens, originally built according to the Rajput style of architecture, were used for royal duck shooting parties during monsoons.</p>
            
            <p>In recent years, the palace and the lake have undergone extensive renovation and restoration work. While the palace is not open to the public, its beautiful exterior and reflection in the lake's waters, especially during sunset, make it one of Jaipur's most photographed monuments.</p>
